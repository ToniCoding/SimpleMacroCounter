## Project Versions

### v0.3.0 (Unreleased)
**Features Added**
- Implemented a PHP path router.
- Added new Apache configurations via `.htaccess`.
- Added dedicated public pages:
  - Registration form.
  - Login form.
  - 404 Not Found page.
- Added a separate PHP file to handle both registration and login form submissions.
- Added security to the registration form against resubmissions and CSRF attacks.
- Added new table `user_goals` to SMC database.
- Added database repositories for the following tables:
  - User metrics.  
  - User daily calorie intake.
  - User macro-nutrients goals.
- Added a favicon.
- Initialized user metrics and goals automatically upon registration.
- SMC is now able to process all the three macro-nutrients thanks to `CombinedMacros` integration.
- Implemented a new service container for macro management.
- Added integration for dynamic and efficent view for macros consumed and their goals.

**Changed**  
- Apache now ignores all favicon requests to serve it as a static file.
- The table `kcals_daily` now have macronutrients columns added.
- Complete refactor for `MacrosCounter` to correctly represent a macro and its controller and view class.
- `Macro` class now works alogside with `CombinedMacros` to represent and manage all three macro-nutrients with a single controller.
- SMC now checks if the user has registered data in `kcals_daily` in the current date and if not, one registry is inserted.

**Fixed Issues**  
- Fixed duplicated database connections by caching the PDO instance within the same request.
- Fixed duplicate GET requests caused by browsers requesting a missing favicon.
- Fixed the issue where `auth_token` was not being cleared after logout.

**Improvements to be done**
- Combine register and login page, filtering the shown form by the URI.

### v0.2.0 (31-08-2025)
**Features Added:**
- Implemented a service container.
- Implemented a bootstrap service.
- Implemented user registration and login system.
- Implemented user tokenization session.
- Improved code documentation.
- Improved app constants access and file.
- Replaced the plain text file `nextSteps.txt` with the better option `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

**Known issues:**
- Multiple database connections are being made. It is needed to change that to hold one lazy connection to it.

**Next version:**
- Fix the multiple connections to database.
- First user forms for register and login.
- More use of the logging module to control what's happening in the app.
- Implement repositories for the rest of the database tables.
